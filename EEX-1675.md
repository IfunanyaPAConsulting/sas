As a traveler, I want to check the status of my SAS flight by entering the flight number, so I can quickly find specific flight details.

GIVEN I am on the SAS Flight Status page
WHEN I select the “Flight number” tab, enter my flight number and travel date, and click the “Search” button
THEN I see the current status and details for that flight, including scheduled and actual times, gate, and terminal information
